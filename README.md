# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project, I developed an OOP applicationn that created two clocks that displayed simultaneously and allowed for user input.

#What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job with including functions and minimizing main(). I also was able to display and enable correct menu function options in the user menu. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
An enhancement I could add to my code would be adding comments and also making sure I clear the screen. These improvemets will make my code more efficient and secure because adding comments helps describe logic, or blocks of code as additional contextual information. It also helps others who don't know how your code works. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The pieces of code I found to be the most challenging to write was the code for displayClock(). Using the Chada Tech Clocks Functional Requirements document helped overcome this challenege. Utilizing search engines, articles, and coding tutorials are great resources that I will be adding to my support network.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills from this project that will be particularly transferable to other course work are the skills of using in-line comments and also using appropriate variable, parameter, and other naming conventions while coding in order to ensure clarity, efficiency, and consistency. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by having a consistent naming scheme with variables. I also made sure the code I wrote was easy to modify and test.
